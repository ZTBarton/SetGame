#  Set Game (Project 1) Read Me

Things I did well:

• Setup of Model and ViewModel
• UI looks nice and is functional
• Landing page
• Overall cleanliness and efficiency of code
• Good amount of comments

Things I did not do so well:

• Some of the animations aren't very smooth
• Bug that I mentioned in the rubric

Note: Additional insights were left in the rubric where it asked about our experience.
